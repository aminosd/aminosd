### 👋 Hi, I'm Amine — Experienced Data Engineer | GCP Expert

I design and scale cloud-native data systems that power experimentation, marketing, and machine learning at multinational enterprise scale. Currently at H&M Group (Stockholm), I build and maintain robust, low-latency pipelines and event-driven infrastructure serving millions of customers globally.

I specialize in building modular, observable, and production-grade pipelines — not just prototypes. I engineer solutions that last.

#### 🚀 What I Do Best

    ⚙️ Build scalable ETL pipelines e.g. Apache Beam (Python) on Dataflow — powering H&M’s internal A/B testing platform used across brands

    🧱 Model data transformations using DBT to ensure versioning, testing, and documentation are always part of the deployment

    ⚡ Orchestrate event-driven systems with Cloud Run, Workflows, and Cloud Functions — serverless-first by design

    🧪 Enable experimentation at scale — ingesting and transforming billions of events daily with full lineage and monitoring

    📈 Deliver marketing performance insights using lightweight MMM pipelines across digital channels, driving measurable ROI

    🛡️ Ensure production stability with CI/CD, alerting, monitoring, and rollback strategies — no silent pipeline failures

#### 🧠 What I Don't Do

    🚫 I don't rely on scheduled cron jobs where event triggers make sense

    🚫 I don't skip monitoring or deployment pipelines

    🚫 I don't treat notebooks as production environments

    🚫 I don’t hardcode — everything is parameterized, tested, and modular

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
